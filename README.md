# hello-world
Just another repository

I move wild but aware since a child I knew I would be here
I said it loud, still nobody would hear
But if a tree falls in the forest and you ain't near
Does it still make a sound or will sound disappear?
Huh? Exactly, just as I expected
Knew if I kept droppin' they'd hear it at any second
